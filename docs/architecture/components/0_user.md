# User

Users are those who submit ZK Proofs to be verified in Aligned. 

Users can range from individual users who want to have their proofs verified and validated with the security of Ethereum, to big projects who want their proofs systematically verified and validated with the security of Ethereum; for example any ZK L2, ZK DA, or even a ZK gaming platform.

Users can generate and submit any ZK proof of any one of the current [supported proving systems](../../guides/0_submitting_proofs.md#supported-verifiers). To view how a User can submit a proof, you can follow our [Submitting Proofs](../../guides/0_submitting_proofs.md) guide

Of course he can manually generate and send any one of these proofs, but Aligned's real use case are ZK and Provable programs.

For the User to build a Provable Program, he can follow our [Using Aligned on your App](../../guides/2_using_aligned_on_your_app.md) guide.
