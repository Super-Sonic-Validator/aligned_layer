# Aggregator

The Aggregator is the entity responsible for the aggregation of [Operator](./operator.md)'s BLS Signatures'. 

When the quorum of responses is reached, the Aggregator will submit a Task Response with the aggregated signatures back to the [Aligned Service Manager](./service_manager.md).
