# Explorer

The [Explorer](https://explorer.alignedlayer.com) is a passive Component that monitors and keeps track of [Aligned Service Manager](./3_service_manager_contract.md).

It has an internal state of previous batches, actively listens for new batches and their response. The Explorer then displays this information for Users to visualize the submitted batches, their states and more useful information in real time.
