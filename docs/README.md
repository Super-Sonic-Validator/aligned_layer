# Aligned

Aligned is a decentralized zero-knowledge (ZK) proof verification and aggregation layer for Ethereum. 

As an [EigenLayer](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/overview) Actively Validated Service (AVS), Aligned borrows economic security from Ethereum through restaking to ensure that proofs are correctly verified and settled on Ethereum. Our [testnet](https://mirror.xyz/0x7794D1c55568270A81D8Bf39e1bcE96BEaC10901/F99hEjkxcsWNefjnaEhoxCOPgHn0I7oJG3fflRjQUGU) can currently process more than 1000 proofs per second and reduces the current cost of verification by 90%.

Aligned allows for fast and cost-effective verification of any SNARK proof on Ethereum and is designed to flexibly support the integration of new proving systems without the need to write custom verifiers in solidity. Currently, proof verification is a bottleneck in the proof supply chain. Aligned is eliminating this bottleneck in order to enable new secure and provable services and applications. As a new layer of the modular stack, Aligned unlocks new ways to design decentralized systems that can meet novel use cases.

Our mission is to accelerate Ethereum's roadmap and the adoption of verifiable computation by enabling fast and economical verification of ZK and validity proofs.

Our veteran team comes from [LambdaClass](https://lambdaclass.com/), a venture studio with years of experience building ZK infrastructure for top projects in the ecosystem. We believe that ZK is the future of decentralized applications and are eager to support developers and researchers who share this vision. We are open source from day 1.
